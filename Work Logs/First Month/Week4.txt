Day 1 - 5:

Project Name: Effect of Cyclic Stick and Rudder Pedal
Description: A simulated VR application on how to fly a helicopter with cyclic stick and rudder pedal.

Scenes:
1. Disclaimer Scene.
2. Introduction Scene.
3. MainScene.

Functionalities:
1. Setting the position of the helicopter in the MainScene.
2. Fetching the values of cyclic stick and rudder pedal.
3. Creating an algorithm for the rotation of the helicopter when using cyclic stick.
4. Using rudder pedal for yaw movement of the helicopter.

Work of Math:

if x == 1 and y == 0 : Helicopter moves sideways towards the Right.
if x == -1 and y == 0 : Helicopter moves sideways towards the left.

if x >= 0.8 and x <= 1 and y > 0: Helicopter will move forward and turns more towards the right side.
if x >= 0.8 and x <= 1 and y < 0: Helicopter will move backward and turns more towards the right side.
if x >= -1 and x <= -0.8 and y < 0: Helicopter will move backward and turns more towards the left side.
if x >= -1 and x <= -0.8 and y > 0: Helicopter will move backward and turns more towards the right side.

if y >= 0.8 and y <= 1 and x > 0: Helicopter will move forward and turns slightly towards the right side.
if y >= 0.8 and y <= 1 and x < 0: Helicopter will move backward and turns slightly towards the right side.
if y >= -1 and y <= -0.8 and x < 0: Helicopter will move backward and turns slightly towards the left side.
if y >= -1 and y <= -0.8 and x > 0: Helicopter will move backward and turns slightly towards the right side.
